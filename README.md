Incremental Image Alignment Library
===================================

This is a library of incremental image alingment algorithms using OpenCV C++ interface (from 2.0).

Incremental Image alingment is used in tracking applications. In this applications you find the
pose of the object in the scene by any means (i.e. object detection) and subsquently the pose
is reestimated in the current frame using the pose in the former frame. In order to motion
estimation to be possible a motion model of the object is assumed. Therefore, in this context
pose stands for motion parameters for a given motion model.

The elements of any incremental image alignment are:

  * The object model (a single texture image, a planar appearance model, AAM, 3D morphable model, etc).
  * The motion model (2D similarity, 2D affine, 2D homography, 3D pose (rotation and traslation), etc).
  * The optimisation procedure (Gauss-Newton, Levenberg–Marquardt, etc).

Those elements are provided in the library and also a C++ design that allows to easily introduce
efficient technicques for incremental image alignment:

The ImgAlignLib already provides:

  * Jacobian factorisation for planar tracking (with a single texture object model) with
    2D similarity, affine and homography based motion models.
  * Jacobian factorisation for planar tracking using 2D appearance models
    (i.e. PCA of deforming faces)::

  * A demo program for planar tracking.
  * A demo program for 2D appearance tracking of faces.
  * The .xml file for umbrello modeller with the UML design behind the implementation (doc/img_align_lib_model.xml).

Requirements
------------

You need the following libraries installed on you system in order to
build ImgAlignLib:

* `OpenCV <http://www.opencv.org/>`
* `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`

Installation
------------

In order to compile the ImgAlignLib package you have to::

        $ cd img_align_lib/src
        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ cmake ..
        $ make

If everything went OK, you should be able to install the
package with::

        $ sudo make install

And then to test planar alignment you can run::

        $ test_img_align
 
and then to test the face appearance model based aligment::

        $ test_pca_model_align
